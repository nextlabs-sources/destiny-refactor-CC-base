Miscellaneous things to make Linux life easier

Product files
=============

- destiny-i386.conf
  so file directory for the ldconfig, to be installed as part of the product

- bjfse
  The new service script (supposedly replace start_agent), to be installed as part 
  of the product

Development tool
================

- bluejunglerc
  Setup all the environment variables for the Linux to work with perforce and compile

- setplatformrc
  Setup the environment variables for Linux to compile

- bjbjfiles
  List of files to send to BJBJ team.  We should have control on this because we
  cannot export all the files to foreign country.

- start_agent
  A start script to run the agent (probably obsolute when kernel driver is introduced)


I know product files and development tools shouldn't put together....
