Component Manager is a minimalist component container.  It frees developers from having to
implement some fundamental patterns like singleton.  It also provides convenient initialization
including providing a Log (see Appache-Commons logging).  It is losely-based on ideas
from Apache Avalon project.

<strong>Features provided include:</strong>
<ul> 
	<li>Singleton Lifestyle</li>
	<li>Transient Lifestyle</li>
	<li>Threaded Lifestyle</li>
	<li>Pooled Lifestyle</li>
	<li>Component-specific log intialization</li>
	<li>Component Initialization</li>
	<li>Component Disposal</li>
	<li>Component Start</li>
	<li>Component Shutdown</li>
    <li>Component Configuration</li>
</ul>

Registration of components is dynamic and programmatic.  It is accomplished by providing
a ComponentInfo object to the component manager.  Component info specifies the name of
the component, the name of the implementation class, name of the interface (optional),
component configuration (optional),
and desired lifestyle type for the component.  See LifestyleType documentation for
an explanation of what each lifestyle means.  Registration and retrieval can be done
in one shot for convenience.

<p></p>
Notice that component info does not contain information regarding what other functionality
the component would like to utilize.  That is determined dynamically based on the
component's implementation.  For example, if the component wishes to use logging, the
implementation class should implement ILogEnabled interface.  See the documentation for
other interfaces for details of what functionality they expose.  In addition, if a
component wishes to utilize all the functionality, it can implement ICompleteComponent
interface, which is just a convenience interface that iherits from all others.  Such
a component can utilize a convenience base class ComponentImplBase that provides some
implementations for these methods.
<p></p>
There is a couple of different ways to get an instance of a component.  One way to do this
is to implement IHasComponentInfo interface in the class that you want componentized.  
Here's an example of how to do that:

<pre>
public class TestComponent
	extends ComponentImplBase 
	implements IHasComponentInfo, ICompleteComponent {
    public static final String NAME = TestComponent.class.getName();
    
    private static final ComponentInfo COMP_INFO = 
        new ComponentInfo(NAME, NAME, null, LifestyleType.SINGLETON_TYPE);
    
    public ComponentInfo getComponentInfo() {
        return COMP_INFO;
    }
</pre>	
	
Now test component can be instantiated like this:

<pre>
	IComponentManager manager = ComponentManagerFactory.getComponentManager();
	TestComponent tc = (TestComponent) manager.getComponent(TestComponent.class);
</pre>
	
Alternatively, ComponentInfo can simply be constructed and passed to the component
manager, like this:

<pre>
	ComponentInfo info = new ComponentInfo(compName, implName, ifName, LifestyleType.SOME_TYPE);
	ifName newComponent = manager.getComponent(info);
</pre>
Finally, as the examples above show, component manager itself should be retrieved from
ComponentManagerFactory.
